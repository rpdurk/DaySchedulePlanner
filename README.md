# Day Schedule Planner

This is a simple calendar app that lets you save tasks for each hour for a single day to local storage.  The app will refresh every hour to update a continuous time to keep you on track.  It is powered through jquery, css, html.

Using jquery elements are dynamically rendered on the DOM.  moment() is used to keep track of time.

## Use

```
Time management is an essential skill to finish any task on time.  Planned worrying is a technique that can be used to help manage someone time.  At the beginning of a work day or set of tasks, take time to worry, by mapping out what needs to be done.
```

### Author + Future Considerations

This App was written by Ryan Durk by the support of a tutor and mentorship of several peers. 

There are still several places for improvement.

* For added productivity, there should be a location to add important tasks (like a to do list)
* Depending on someone's schedule, they might want specific hours, having a button to add or alter hours would be great
* Timeslots per half an hour would be more ideal
* Multiple days worth of planning would be helpful
* Finally, a clear button should be added to ensure items could be changed with new information
